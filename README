	NOTES ABOUT CURRENT VERSION

There are problems using some versions of gcc on some platforms.
In case Blassic core dumps on exiting or when a program has an
error, compile it using -O0

The regular expression functions are not supported under windows.

The bidirectional POPEN may or may not work on windows depending
on the windows version used.

Now configure admits several options: --disable-graphics to compile
without graphics support and --disable-curses to compile without
curses nor ncurses. In the last case, CLS, LOCATE and other
instructions when used in text mode are silently ignored. In the
former, trying to enter in graphics mode generates an error.
If curses is enabled, first ncurses is tested, if not available
curses is used instead. The --disable-ncurses option skips the
ncurses test and uses always curses.

When configuring for unix/linux, using --without-x has the same
effect as --disable-graphics. For windows is ignored.

Several scripts to call configure are provided, see the do_conf*
files.


	NOTES ABOUT CROSS-COMPILING BLASSIC

The cross-compiling has been simplified in Blasic 0.10.0, it must now
automatically use the native compiler to create gencharset. If this
fails you can manually compile it, or create a dummy, it does not
need to be executed unless the charset data files are modified.

To run the test of dynamic linking of functions do:

	make testdl.so

	./blassic testdl

On windows with Borland C++ Builder build the project testdl and do:

	blassic testdl

There is no other documentation than the testdl.cpp source, sorry.

	BASIC /bay'-sic/ n. 

A programming language, originally designed for Dartmouth's experimental
timesharing system in the early 1960s, which for many years was the leading
cause of brain damage in proto-hackers. Edsger W. Dijkstra observed in
"Selected Writings on Computing: A Personal Perspective" that "It is
practically impossible to teach good programming style to students that have
had prior exposure to BASIC: as potential programmers they are mentally
mutilated beyond hope of regeneration." This is another case (like Pascal)
of the cascading lossage that happens when a language deliberately designed
as an educational toy gets taken too seriously. A novice can write short
BASIC programs (on the order of 10-20 lines) very easily; writing anything
longer (a) is very painful, and (b) encourages bad habits that will make it
harder to use more powerful languages well. This wouldn't be so bad if
historical accidents hadn't made BASIC so common on low-end micros in the
1980s. As it is, it probably ruined tens of thousands of potential wizards.

	"The new hacker's dictionary"

I disagree with this point of view, but...
